# World Population Analysis  

## Introduction  
The **World Population Dataset** from the **World Bank** provides yearly population estimates for **266 countries/regions** from **1960 to 2023**. This dataset helps analyze **global demographic trends, regional variations, and historical impacts** on population growth.  

## Objective  
- Examine **global and country-level population growth trends**.  
- Identify **fastest-growing and declining regions**.  
- Analyze **demographic shifts**, including urbanization and density.  
- Assess **historical events' impact** on population changes.  

## Steps Conducted  

### 1. **Data Overview and Cleaning**  
- Removed the **"Not classified"** row due to missing data.  
- Replaced missing values in **West Bank and Gaza** with **0**.  
- Dropped unnecessary columns: **"Country Code", "Indicator Name", "Indicator Code", "Unnamed: 68"**.  

### 2. **Global Population Trends**  
- **Total population grew from ~3 billion (1960) to over 8 billion (2023)**.  
- Peak growth occurred **between the 1970s and 1990s**, but the rate has slowed since **2000**.  

### 3. **Country-Level Insights**  
- **India** surpassed China as the most populated country in **2023**.  
- **Small island nations** like **Tuvalu and San Marino** remain the least populated.  

### 4. **Regional Trends**  
- **Africa**: Fastest-growing continent, with **Nigeria and Ethiopia** leading.  
- **Europe**: Population **declining** in countries like **Italy and Russia** due to aging demographics.  
- **Asia**: **Chinaâ€™s growth slowing**, while **India and the Philippines** continue expanding.  
- **North America**: **Moderate growth**, with **Canada relying on immigration**.  
- **Latin America**: **Steady growth**, but declining birth rates in some regions.  

### 5. **Urbanization and Density Insights**  
- **High-density countries**: **Bangladesh, India, Netherlands**.  
- **Low-density countries**: **Mongolia, Australia, Canada**.  

### 6. **Impact of Global Events**  
- **COVID-19** led to **lower birth rates and migration shifts**.  
- **Wars and conflicts** impacted populations in **Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen**.  

### 7. **Data Scaling for Readability**  
- Population values were converted to **millions** for better interpretation.  

## Results  
- **Global population growth is slowing**, with the highest contributions from **Africa and South Asia**.  
- **Aging populations and declining birth rates** are reshaping demographics in **Europe and East Asia**.  
- **Historical events, such as pandemics and wars, significantly impacted population trends**.  

## Conclusion  
The dataset provides valuable insights into **long-term population trends**, highlighting regional differences and historical influences. The findings can support **policy-making, urban planning, and economic forecasting**.
